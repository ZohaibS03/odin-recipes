            <li>1 1/2 tsp garam masala</li>

        <h2>Step by Step Recipe:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oven to 120C/100C fan/ gas 1/2. Make a paste by blitzing the chilli, ginger and tomato together, then set aside.</li>
            <li>Mix the gram flour with the spices. Add all the prepared vegetables and toss in the mix. Slowly add 150ml water until the batter coats the vegetables – they should be well coated, but not swimming in it.</li>
            <li>Add the tomato mixture and get your hands in there, mixing well until everything is incorporated. Add a little lemon juice and seasoning.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil to 180C. Take a handful of the mix and squeeze it into a loose little ball, to ensure the vegetables stick to each other when lowered in the oil. Use a spoon to carefully drop the ball into the oil.</li>
            <li>Fry for about 4 mins until golden and crispy, then taste to test for seasoning and consistency. You may also need to add a little water or gram our to the mixture at this point if your tester ball didn’t hold together. Repeat, frying the remaining mixture in batches.</li>
            <li>Drain on kitchen paper and keep warm in the oven as you go. Serve immediately with chutney.</li>
